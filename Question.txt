HTTP/1.1 400 XXX
Connection: close

Q: TCP is not closed if we telnet google, but in this project we just wait for a fix amount of time?
A: 关于time out，google和 amazon不time out是因为他们有很多资源。对于这个project，要time out！

nc 是line buffered的，可以在一个terminal打命令到一半，再开一个terminal，测试concurrency

curl 也是很好的命令，可以试试。

To test access control, open etc/hosts, add a domain name
Solution 2, log in ieng6, type “hostname”, that one is global registered. You can explicitly ssh ieng6-202.ucsd.edu for example.



(x)Q1: Why I cannot put the "close(csock)" inside of the if(fork()==0) area
    The error seems that the browser cannot refresh the page
	Ming : if we don't "close(csock)" out of the area, the client will wait there untill server shuts down.

Q: //no extension in file name regard it as a path 
These are all the same?:
	/page1
	/page1/
	/page1/index.html
A: .. is not allowed anywhere in URL

Q: access control, what does “don’t need to consider recursive…”
	E.x.
	/secretFolder/htdocs/index.html  only highest

Q: access control, how to deal with domain name? nslookup?

Q: recv might receive part of the packet, as in the book
            //Can this be accomplished by checking \r\n\r\n ?
	
	E.x.
	[GET /page]  and then [/hello.txt HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n]  or some header in the middle

Q: how to avoid “bind error, port is in use”
A: use different port
	

Q: What is the test environment of the project, i.e. compiler, OS, etc.


GET /intl/en/about HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
====>I test this kind of request in google, it said permanently removed and return the correct URL. “/intl/en/about/“

GET /gp/goldbox HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.com
====>But this is fine. Amazon may parse goldbox as a folder, but google don’t.

GET /gp/goldbox/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.com
====>fine

GET gp/goldbox/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.com
====>400 bad request


Notes:

1. Becareful of using string operation, data can have 0 in the middle of content. 
2. Request version number may later than 1.1, now respond 1.1 or 1.0(if no pipeline is support)
3. If the header have the "Connection: close" from client, no need to analyze it. 
    if the server want to response "HTTP/1.1 400 client Error\r\nConnection: close" , then it can close the socket
