Q1: Why I cannot put the "close(csock)" inside of the if(fork()==0) area
    The error seems that the browser cannot refresh the page
	Ming : if we don't "close(csock)" out of the area, the client will wait there untill server shuts down.

Q2: What is the test environment of the project, i.e. compiler, OS, etc.
